Installation
------------

### Firefox

1. Install [GreaseMonkey] if you do not have it already
1. Go to [the latest release]
1. Do NOT click "Jira_Board-No-Horizontal-Scroll.user.js",
   Firefox would download it instead of installing
1. Click on the tag name that is shown below "Latest release"
1. Click on "Jira_Board-No-Horizontal-Scroll.user.js"
1. Click on "Raw"
1. Install or update Jira Board-No-Horizontal-Scroll

### Chrome

1. Install [Tampermonkey] if you do not have it already
1. Go to [the latest release]
1. Do NOT click "Jira_Board-No-Horizontal-Scroll.user.js",
   Chrome would download it instead of installing
1. Click on the tag name that is shown below "Latest release"
1. Click on "Jira_Board-No-Horizontal-Scroll.user.js"
1. Click on "Raw"
1. Install or update Jira Board-No-Horizontal-Scroll



Update
------

As GitHub does not support a URL that always resolves to the latest released version
of a file, a @downloadURL cannot be specified for the script, and thus the browser
add-ons are not capable of automatically updating the script. So to update it,
just repeat the installation procedure.
